#raytracer

A friend suggested that I build my own ray tracer as one of my small project. Peter Shirley's book is written for people who have moderate programming experience and knowledge of high school mathematics. He goes through the construction of classes and basic maths in order to write a functional ray tracer in under 2000 lines of code. This is my attempt to do what he did!
